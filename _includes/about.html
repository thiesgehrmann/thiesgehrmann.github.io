                    <p>I am a bioinformatician at the <a href="http://cbs.knaw.nl">CBS/KNAW</a>, working on the assembly of fungal genomes. Finally, my goal is to identify genes or functional elements involved in the production of specific compounds, or antifungal resistance.</p>

                    <p>As a result, I am interested in all steps between sequencing and variant analysis, including assembly, alignment, variant discovery, and association studies. In the fungal domain, there exist many species specific problems that are as yet unresolved.</p>
