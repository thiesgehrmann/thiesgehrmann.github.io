title: DT-cut: Dynamic tree cut
description: <p> DT-Cut is a clustering tool based on hierarchical clustering. Rather than cutting the dendrogram at a specific threshold, it cuts based on a statistical test at each node. It uses a dynamic correction procedure to maintain a given famile wise error rate (bonferroni correction).</p>
